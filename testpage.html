        It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
        something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t
        realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again.
        There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there
        wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="line">Mr. Dursley blinked and stared</span> at the cat. It stared back. As Mr.
        Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in
        his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no,
        looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave
        himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove
        toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was
        hoping to get that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
        else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help
        noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
        about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in
        funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was
        some stupid new fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a
        huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering
        excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them
        weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and
        wearing an emerald-green cloak!
